# Deep Learning Study Session Log

This file records each study session for accountability, recall practice, and iteration history.
## Session: 2026-02-14 13:16:07 KST
- Repository: /Users/lukelee/Study/deep-learning-from-scratch-2/repo
- User language: English
- Study mode: Beginner-first, concept-first
- Action requested: Start study plan and keep session log + concepts
- Log policy: Append every session with topics, concepts covered, outcomes, next steps
 - Q/A: User guessed 'data quality'. Confirmed as first diagnostic priority in most cases; follow-up checks = labels, objective/loss mismatch, then model/optimizer issues.
 - Next concept emphasis: how to distinguish data noise from label noise vs objective mismatch before changing architecture.
 

- Q/A: When model performs badly, choose **1 (data quality) first** as the default diagnosis path. If data is clean and aligned, then check **loss/objective mismatch (2)**.
